# Guildbot
This bots main purpose was/ is for personal use only, future updates to it may make it more friendly towards outsiders.

## Before using
Assuming that you read the above message and were like "I still wanna use it tho"..<br />
You'll need to do the following:
1.   Rename `edit.config.json` to `config.json`
2.   Rename `object/edit.settings.sqlite` to `objects/settings.sqlite`
3.   Edit `config.json` and input your `client token`, `home server`, and your `discord id` in the obvious spots
4.   You may also wish to edit the `prefix` to something more unique.

If you don't know how to find any of the above information, or simply don't know how to run this bot, there are plenty of guides on the internet that explain how to do so. It is not my job to babysit you, so I expect you to at least know how to find this information yourself.
