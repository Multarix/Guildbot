This page serves as an introduction to Guildbot.<br/>
For a full rundown of all the commands/ features please visit [this link](https://multarix.github.io/Guildbot/commands).

### Who are you, and what is Guildbot?

Hi, I'm Multarix. I'm an Australian gamer dude thing... yeah idk how to describe who I am.<br/>
Guildbot is a discord bot that I created to do various things which is explained further down the page.

### So what can Guildbot do?

Guildbot can do a wide variety of things. Such as:
- Create a starboard, to keep track of all those funny (or stupid) things that people say.
- Tracks how many messages a user sends for a "points" system.
- Support custom prefixes.
- Display information about a user.
- Mass delete messages.

### So how does it work?

Guildbot runs on Javascript, using Node and the Discord.js library. It also uses an Sqlite database for storing information, such as custom prefixes.<br/>
Its code is readily available on github [here](https://github.com/Multarix/Guildbot). And even allows you to download and run the bot yourself if you wish to make an separate version of it.

### So why should I use Guildbot instead of any other bot?

Honestly, that's up to you to decide. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Guildbot is likely to continue to receive updates to fix bugs, optimize code and add new features.<br/>
The main reason for the existence of the bot was, and still is as a personal project. Most of the features are either as a proof of concept, Expand my knowledge of Javascript or features that become needed and/ or wanted within my personal discord or friends discord. Some of these features may align with things that you want/ need as well.

If you wish to use this bot on your server, you may do so by [clicking here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=260372003310010368&scope=bot&permissions=2146958551).<br/>
It is strongly advised not to change the permissions that it asks for as they are required for the bot to function.
